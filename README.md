Time Complexity of Plus Minus: The time complexity of this code is O(n) because this code
only has 1 for loop and no other recurssive elements that impact time complexity. The reason why this for
loop only yields a O(n) is because we only need to linearly go through the list of numbers 1 time each.

Space Complexity of Plus Minus: The space complexity of of this code is O(c) because this code
takes in a list and does not change the list while the code runs. This list is ued to refference hte numbers within
in order to determine if the numbers are positive, negative, or zero.
